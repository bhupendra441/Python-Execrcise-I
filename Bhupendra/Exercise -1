Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right

Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

#python 3.5.2
import random
player_name=input("enter your name ")
print("Hi "+player_name+" lets play guessing game")
guess_track=0
random_number=random.randint(1,9)
while True:
      #generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including both)
    guess_number=input("guess the number between 1 and 9")
    guess_number=int(guess_number)
    guess_track=guess_track+1
    if  guess_number<random_number:
        print("your guessed number is too low")
    elif guess_number>random_number:
        print("your guessed number is too high")
    elif (guess_number == random_number):
        print(" you guessed right number after",guess_track,"guess")
        guess_track=0
        random_number = random.randint(1, 9)
    else:
        print(" you guessed wrong number ")
    game_action=input('Type "exit" if you want to quit game,else press enter to continue')
    if game_action=="exit":
        break
